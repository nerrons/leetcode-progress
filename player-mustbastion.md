- #1 - two sum
- #2 - add two numbers

- #3 - longest substring without repeating characters. sliding window. maintain two pointers and do a single pass, so there's no need for a `isUnique` on every combination of substrings. optimize: use a map so the first pointer can jump over.

Doing some easy problems on arrays.
- #832 - flipping an image.
- #905 - sort array by parity.
- #977 - squares of a sorted array. double pointers.
- #561 - array partition i.
- #1051 - height checker. counting sort.
- #1002 - find common characters.
- #1122 - relative sort array.
- #1160 - find words... 
- #1185 - day of the week. Sakamoto Algorithm.
- #1200 - minimum absolute difference.
- #1217 - play with chips. trash problem.
- #509 - fibonacci number.
- #766 - toeplitz matrix.
- #867 - transpose matrix. actually spent some time on this.
- #922 - sort array by parity ii.
- #985 - sum of even numbers after queries.
- #999 - available captures for rook.
- #1170 - compare strings... a good take on using the constraints. If something is small and needs to be counted, it's often worth it to use buckets.
- #1089 - duplicate zeros. classic two-pointers; a good practice on edge cases.
- #888 - fair candy swap. basically the same as Two Sum; the use of `unordered_set` and `accumulate`; probably bitset.
- #1013 - partition array...
